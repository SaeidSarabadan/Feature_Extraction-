# Feature_Extraction-
Feature_Extraction in Inception_module.
In this code snippet, the inception_module function defines an inception module with multiple paths of convolutions and concatenation. It takes an input layer and a tuple of filter sizes for the different paths.

The example usage creates a simple neural network model that includes an Inception module for image recognition. The model architecture is printed using model.summary().

You can further build on this code by adding additional layers, training the model on an image dataset, and testing its performance on image recognition tasks
